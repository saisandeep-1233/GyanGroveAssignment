The project is a React-based web application that leverages Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness across different devices. It fetches data from an API and displays it using a responsive layout provided by Bootstrap. 
I also implemented infinite scrolling for the recommended shows section, by dynamically loading more content as the user scrolls.


Setup and Local Run Instructions:
i)Clone the project from the git repository
git clone https://github.com/saisandeep-1233/GyanGroveAssignment.git
ii)Navigate to project directory
iii)Install dependencies(npm i )
iv)run the project (npm run dev)

Explanation of Design and Technical Decisions:

I have used react for developing this project and used bootstrap for implementing the responsiveness for desktop and mobiles.
Fetched the data from the api's provided and displayed them 
Implemented the endless fetching and as the user reaches the end of the data is fetched from the next page
